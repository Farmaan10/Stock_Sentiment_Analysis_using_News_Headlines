# Stock_Sentiment_Analysis_using_News_Headlines
Project to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease depending on the polarity of the news headlines

#### Label '0': 
              Negative News and Stock Price might decrease the next day.
#### Label '1':
              Positive News and Stock Price might increase the next day.
I have used the Random Forest Classifier and Bag of Words.
The prepared model gives a score of 85.18%.
